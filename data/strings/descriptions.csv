nadejensynod_vrana,SHIP,"Vrana, also called 'Hajduk' in Nadeje after the first ship of this class, has a complicated history. Originally a fractured hulk of a Falcon-class ship, Hajduk was reassembled and retrofitted with heavy armor and larger weapon mounts, and served the Prophet faithfully in his war against the heretics. When the insurgents seized the Yanichar station and its industrial capabilities, Prophet's flagship served as a blueprint for the first Nadejen original ship class, boasting a greatly increased combat prowess while maintaining most of Falcon's maneurability.",,,,
nadejensynod_sovuljaga,SHIP,"Sovuljaga, the eagle-owl, was created to be the Eagle to Vrana's Falcon, but evolved to be much more than that as the independence war raged on. Equipped with a heavy ballistic battery, twin flight decks and armor to rival even some capital-class ships, it is well poised to become a nightmare in the hands of a skilled admiral, as the Hegemony suppression fleet discovered in the battle of Voskreseniye Belt - if they manage to stay ahead of its potentially disastrous flux accumulation speed.",,,,
nadejensynod_elif,CUSTOM,"Long seen as nothing but Selin's focal celestial body, Elif was settled by the decree of the Prophet from a mix of zealous Zofians and hopeful Selinites. In the years since his disappearance, the colony has shown the beginnings of developing its own cultural identity, though it is still often forgotten by Nadejens in the system at large.",,,,
nadejensynod_selin,CUSTOM,"Zofia's sister world, Selin never was as fortunate as the former. Its burgeoning colonies were shaken by the Collapse from which they never fully recovered, and the newly-formed Hegemony hardly paid attention to a backwater planet in a fringe system. Even when the loss of Zofia had the Hegemony pump resources into the desert world, Selin was only seen as a fortress from which to project power in the system. Now, this finally begins to change. As Synod's military capital, Selin at last has begun reestablishing its economy and sense of self.",,,,
nadejensynod_yanichar,CUSTOM,"Built after Zofia's rebellion in the First AI War, Yanichar station was a giant military base intended to support the Hegemony fleets and project power in Nadeje, but this purpose was turned on its head when the Prophet led a daring attack and seized Yanichar for his insurgency. Guided by incomprehensible blueprints he claimed were given to him by divine spirits during his spacing, the Prophet rebuilt Yanichar's repair docks into a gargantuan industrial complex which it remains to this day.",,,,
nadejensynod_zofia,CUSTOM,"The jewel of Nadejen star system, Zofia is a near-terran world scarred by war. Settled long before the Collapse, Zofia fared better than most until the arrival of the XIVth battlegroup and the establishment of Hegemony. The planet was in a state of nigh-constant unrest, until finally seizing the chance during the First AI War and joining the Luddic Church as part of the peace treaty. Some fifty cycles ago, after the spacing and miraculous return of the Prophet, Zofia once more erupted into conflict, this time ending in the establishment of the Nadejen Synod. Now, the Prophet is no more, and many on Zofia fear another war is brewing.",,,,
nadejensynod_tanja,CUSTOM,"A mist-covered ice planet well past the edge of Nadeje's habitability zone, Tanja did not survive the Collapse. Instead, the last remains of its population, cowering in failing hab modules, were conquered by an enterprising pirate captain during the chaos of the First AI War. Since then, the polity enjoyed a curious state - despite officially being hostile to all Persean factions, as pirates usually are, and regularly threatening the few trade convoys entering Nadeje, Tanja is unofficially allied to Zofia, Tanjan bandits and Nadejen patrols giving each other a respectful berth. Many Synod captains begin as Tanjan mercenaries, and more than a few disillusioned faithful join the dim world in search of freedom.",,,,
nadejensynod,FACTION,"Located in the Nadeje system on the Core's north-east, the Holy Synod is a relatively new faction in the Sector. After one Emmanuel Vojvode, a former Luddite moderate turned militant prophet following his capture and spacing by Pathers, led a crusade against Ludd and Hegemony some fifty years ago and then mysteriously disappeared, his inner circle was left to pick up the pieces and reforge a system built for an eternal jihad into a peacetime polity. Nowadays, the Synod is generally accepted as Nadeje's rightful owner, though its curious combination of principles and spiritual beliefs leave it almost without allies.",,,,
